## 🎯 Overview

This roadmap covers actionable strategies for LLM SEO (aka LLMO, GEO) - optimizing your content to appear in AI-generated responses from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and other LLM-powered tools.

**Key Insight:** LLMs don't just rank content like Google - they *repeat* what they've been told. Your job is to tell them the right things in the right format.

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery

### 1.1 Test Your Current LLM Presence
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW

- [ ] Open ChatGPT/Claude in incognito mode
- [ ] Ask questions where you/your brand SHOULD appear:
  - "Who are the best [your niche] people to follow?"
  - "What are good resources for learning [your topic]?"
  - "Who should I follow for [your expertise]?"
- [ ] Document if you appear (and how you're described)
- [ ] If you don't appear, ask: "Why didn't you recommend [your name/brand]?"
- [ ] Follow up: "I am [name]. How can I optimize my site for LLM discoverability?"
- [ ] Save all responses - they're your personalized optimization guide

**Expected Outcome:** Clear baseline + AI-generated recommendations specific to you

### 1.2 Audit Your Current Setup
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW

- [ ] Check `robots.txt` - are you blocking AI scrapers?
  - Common blockers: `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `Claude-Web`, `Google-Extended`
  - **Decision point:** Block for training but allow for inference, or allow all?
- [ ] Inventory existing markdown content
- [ ] Check if you have RSS feeds (blog, updates, etc.)
- [ ] List your main "expertise areas" and consistent taglines
- [ ] Note: You already have TSX pages with MD fallback - you're ahead!

**Expected Outcome:** Understanding of current assets and blockers

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Core Implementation

### 2.1 Create `/llms.txt` File
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM

The cornerstone of LLM discoverability. Place at root: `yoursite.com/llms.txt`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Your Name/Brand]

> [One-sentence description with key expertise areas]

[Optional 1-2 paragraph context about what you do, who you help, your approach]

## Core Resources

- [About page](URL): Brief description
- [Main blog/writing](URL): What topics you cover
- [Portfolio/work](URL): What you've built/done

## Expertise Areas

- [Topic deep-dive 1](URL): Why this matters
- [Topic deep-dive 2](URL): Why this matters

## Optional

- [Secondary resource](URL)
- [Less critical content](URL)
```

**Your Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Write H1 with your name/brand
- [ ] Craft blockquote summary (test: does it capture your unique value?)
- [ ] Add 1-2 paragraph context (keep it factual, not marketing-speak)
- [ ] Create "Core Resources" section with 3-5 key pages
- [ ] Create expertise-based sections (e.g., "Development", "Marketing", etc.)
- [ ] Add "Optional" section for secondary content
- [ ] Link to `.md` versions of pages where possible
- [ ] Test file in LLM: "Read this llms.txt and tell me about this person/brand"

**Pro Tips:**
- Clarity > cleverness (you're writing for robots first)
- Use consistent phrasing you want LLMs to repeat
- Include how you want to be cited/referenced

**Expected Outcome:** Structured, LLM-readable site summary

### 2.2 Create `/for-llms` Page
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM

A dedicated markdown page that's comprehensive but scannable.

**What to Include:**
- [ ] Full bio/background (factual, chronological)
- [ ] Expertise areas with specific examples
- [ ] Notable work/achievements (with metrics where possible)
- [ ] Key philosophies or approaches you're known for
- [ ] Preferred citation format: "Cite me as: [format]"
- [ ] Links to other profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- [ ] Topics you frequently write/speak about
- [ ] Clear, scannable headers (H2, H3)

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Write in third person or clear first person
- Be specific: "built X with Y users" not "built successful products"
- Avoid marketing jargon: "helps developers ship faster" not "revolutionizes development"
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Include dates and timelines where relevant

**Your Implementation Checklist:**

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive, LLM-friendly reference page

### 2.3 Add Markdown Versions of Key Pages
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** MEDIUM-HIGH

The spec recommends making markdown versions available at `[url].md`

**Since you have TSX with MD fallback:**
- [ ] Audit which pages already have clean markdown
- [ ] Identify top 10 most important pages
- [ ] For pages without MD: create clean markdown versions
- [ ] Implement URL pattern: `/page-name` → `/page-name.md` (or `/page-name/index.html.md`)
- [ ] Strip out navigation, ads, CTAs in markdown versions
- [ ] Keep just the core content
- [ ] Test a few in an LLM to verify readability

**Priority Pages for MD Versions:**
1. About/Bio
2. Main services/offerings
3. Top blog posts
4. Case studies/portfolio
5. FAQ/resources

**Expected Outcome:** Clean, LLM-readable versions of key content

### 2.4 Implement Schema.org Structured Data
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** MEDIUM

Help LLMs understand your content with structured data.

**Key Schema Types to Implement:**
- [ ] Person/Organization schema (homepage)
- [ ] Article schema (blog posts)

- [ ] FAQPage (if you have FAQs)
- [ ] HowTo (for tutorials/guides)

**Implementation:**

- [ ] Validate schema markup

**Resources:**
- [Schema.org types](https://schema.org/docs/full.html)
- Your existing framework probably has plugins/helpers

**Expected Outcome:** Machine-readable structured data across site

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Content Optimization

### 3.1 Establish Consistent Brand Language
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW

LLMs learn associations through repetition.

- [ ] Define your "tagline" (one sentence description)
- [ ] Use it EVERYWHERE: Twitter bio, LinkedIn, About page, llms.txt, etc.
- [ ] Define 3-5 "expertise pillars" you want to be known for
- [ ] Use consistent phrasing for these across all content
- [ ] Create a "brand voice doc" with approved phrases

**Example:**

Make your best content more LLM-friendly.

**For Each Key Blog Post/Article:**
- [ ] Add clear, descriptive title (not clickbait)
- [ ] Include date published/updated
- [ ] Add meta description that's factual and complete
- [ ] Use headers (H2, H3) to structure content

- [ ] Ensure markdown version exists
- [ ] Link to related content

**LLM-Friendly Writing Tips:**
- Start with the answer (inverted pyramid style)
- Use specific numbers and dates
- Define acronyms on first use
- Include relevant context
- Structure with scannable headers
- Avoid ambiguous "this" or "that" - be explicit

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify top 10 pieces of content
- [ ] Audit each for LLM-friendliness
- [ ] Update based on guidelines above
- [ ] Create markdown versions
- [ ] Interlink related pieces

**Expected Outcome:** Content optimized for both humans and LLMs

### 3.3 Create LLM-Optimized Content Types
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM | **Effort:** ONGOING

Content formats that LLMs love to cite.

**Consider Creating:**
- [ ] **Definitive guides** - comprehensive, well-structured resources
- [ ] **Comparison posts** - "X vs Y" with clear criteria
- [ ] **How-to tutorials** - step-by-step with clear outcomes
- [ ] **Resource lists** - curated, annotated collections
- [ ] **Case studies** - with specific metrics and outcomes
- [ ] **Glossaries** - define terms in your niche
- [ ] **FAQs** - common questions with complete answers

**Expected Outcome:** Citable, authoritative content in your niche

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Technical Implementation

### 4.1 RSS Feed Optimization
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** LOW

LLMs apparently love RSS feeds.

- [ ] Ensure you have an RSS feed (blog, updates, etc.)
- [ ] Include full content in feed (not just excerpts)
- [ ] Add RSS link to homepage header
- [ ] Reference RSS feed in llms.txt
- [ ] Validate feed format

**Expected Outcome:** Clean, comprehensive RSS feed

### 4.2 Robots.txt Strategy
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** LOW

Critical decision: block or allow AI crawlers?

**Options:**
1. **Allow everything** - Maximum discoverability
2. **Block training, allow inference** - Harder to implement technically
3. **Block everything** - Maximum control, zero LLM presence

**Common AI User-Agents:**
- `GPTBot` (OpenAI)
- `ChatGPT-User` (OpenAI)
- `Claude-Web` (Anthropic)
- `Google-Extended` (Google AI training)
- `CCBot` (Common Crawl)
- `anthropic-ai` (Anthropic)
- `Omgilibot` (Various AI)

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] Review current robots.txt
- [ ] Decide on strategy
- [ ] Update robots.txt accordingly
- [ ] Document decision and rationale

**Expected Outcome:** Intentional crawler access policy

### 4.3 Sitemap for LLM Context
**Priority:** LOW | **Effort:** LOW

While not a replacement for llms.txt, sitemaps help.

- [ ] Ensure you have a sitemap.xml
- [ ] Include markdown versions of pages if implementing
- [ ] Submit to major search engines
- [ ] Reference in llms.txt if relevant

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive site map

---

## 📋 Phase 5: Testing & Iteration

## 📋 Phase 6: Traditional SEO (Because Google Still Matters)

### 6.1 Fix Your Name/Brand Discoverability Issue
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Effort:** MEDIUM

If Google can't find you when someone searches your EXACT name, you have a fundamental SEO problem.

**Diagnosis Checklist:**
- [ ] Google your exact name in quotes: `"YourExactName"`
- [ ] Check if you appear at all in first 3 pages
- [ ] Note which similar names/competitors outrank you
- [ ] Check Google Search Console - is your site even indexed?
- [ ] Search `site:yourdomain.com` - how many pages are indexed?

**Common Causes:**
1. **Site isn't indexed** - Google doesn't know you exist
2. **Weak E-E-A-T signals** - Google doesn't trust you're the "real" you
3. **Competitor/similar name has way more authority** - They're drowning you out
4. **Technical SEO issues** - Robots.txt blocking, no-index tags, poor site structure
5. **New domain** - Hasn't built authority yet

**Immediate Fixes:**

#### A. Get Indexed (If You're Not)
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Request indexing for homepage and key pages
- [ ] Check robots.txt isn't accidentally blocking Googlebot
- [ ] Remove any accidental `noindex` tags
- [ ] Get a few backlinks from any legitimate sites (even small ones)
- [ ] Create/update Google Business Profile if applicable

#### B. Establish Name Authority
- [ ] Add schema.org Person/Organization markup to homepage (same as Phase 2.4)
- [ ] Create a Wikipedia page if you qualify (or Wikidata entry)
- [ ] Get listed in relevant directories (Crunchbase, LinkedIn, industry directories)
- [ ] Publish on Medium/Dev.to/Hashnode with links back to your site
- [ ] Get mentioned in interviews, podcasts, articles (with your exact name + link)
- [ ] Claim your name on major platforms: GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube
  - Use EXACT same name/handle everywhere
  - Link back to your main site from all profiles

#### C. On-Page Name Optimization
- [ ] **Homepage title tag:** `YourName - YourMainExpertise` (exact match crucial)
- [ ] **H1 on homepage:** Your exact name
- [ ] **First paragraph:** Include your full name naturally 2-3 times
- [ ] **About page title:** `About YourName | Additional Context`
- [ ] **Author bylines:** Use exact name consistently on all content
- [ ] **Image alt text:** Include your name for photos of you
- [ ] **URL structure:** Consider `yourdomain.com/yourname` if it's not homepage

#### D. Fight the Confusion
If there's a streamer/competitor with similar name:

- [ ] **Differentiate clearly:** Add your niche to brand
  - Example: If you're "John Smith" and streamer is "Jon Smith", use "John Smith - Web Developer" everywhere
- [ ] **Create disambiguation content:**
  - Blog post: "About [YourName] (Not the Streamer)"
  - FAQ: "Are you [SimilarName] the streamer?" → Clear answer
- [ ] **Leverage your unique identifier:** Middle initial, location, or niche
  - "Jane Doe, Austin" vs just "Jane Doe"
- [ ] **Own the combo searches:** Optimize for "YourName developer", "YourName [yourcity]", etc.

**Expected Outcome:** Your site appears #1 for exact name searches within 2-4 weeks

### 6.2 Technical SEO Audit
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** MEDIUM

The foundation has to be solid.

**Core Technical Checks:**
- [ ] **Google Search Console** - Set up if you haven't
  - Check coverage report for errors
  - Review which pages are indexed
  - Monitor crawl stats
- [ ] **Page speed** - Test on PageSpeed Insights
  - Core Web Vitals passing?
  - Mobile performance?
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly** - Test with Google's mobile-friendly test
- [ ] **HTTPS** - Secure site with SSL certificate
- [ ] **Sitemap** - Generated and submitted to GSC
- [ ] **Robots.txt** - Properly configured (not blocking important pages)
- [ ] **Internal linking** - Every page reachable from homepage in <3 clicks
- [ ] **Broken links** - Audit and fix 404s
- [ ] **Redirect chains** - Fix any multi-step redirects
- [ ] **Duplicate content** - Canonical tags set correctly
- [ ] **Structured data** - No errors in Google's Rich Results Test

**TSX-Specific Considerations:**
Since your site is TSX-based:
- [ ] Verify server-side rendering or pre-rendering is working
  - Test: Disable JavaScript and see if content still appears
  - Or use "View Page Source" - is HTML there?
- [ ] Check that Google can crawl dynamic content
  - Use URL Inspection tool in GSC
  - View "rendered" version
- [ ] Ensure fast load times (React/TSX can be heavy)

**Tools:**
- Google Search Console (free, essential)
- Screaming Frog SEO Spider (free up to 500 URLs)
- PageSpeed Insights (free)
- GTmetrix (free)

**Expected Outcome:** No technical barriers preventing Google from crawling/indexing

- [ ] **Word count:** 800+ for topical posts, 1500+ for pillar content
- [ ] **Images:** Relevant, optimized, alt text with context
- [ ] **Author bio:** Consistent with link to author page
- [ ] **Internal links:** 2-5 links to related content

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### LLM SEO Pitfalls
1. **Over-optimizing for SEO keywords** - LLMs care about clarity and context, not keyword density
2. **Marketing speak** - "Revolutionary", "game-changing" = robot confusion
3. **Incomplete information** - LLMs need full context to cite you accurately
4. **Inconsistent branding** - Using different descriptions in different places
5. **Blocking crawlers then wondering why no LLM presence** - Can't have both
6. **Forgetting to test** - Assumptions ≠ reality, always test in incognito
7. **Setting and forgetting** - LLM landscape evolves quickly, revisit quarterly

### Traditional SEO Pitfalls
1. **Keyword stuffing** - Writing for robots, not humans (Google hates this)
2. **Ignoring mobile** - 60%+ of searches are mobile, mobile-first is mandatory
3. **Slow site speed** - Users and Google both bounce on slow sites
4. **Thin content** - 200-word blog posts won't rank, aim for 800+ minimum
5. **No internal linking** - Help Google understand your site structure
6. **Duplicate content** - Same content on multiple URLs confuses Google
7. **Ignoring Search Console** - Free data goldmine you're not using
8. **No backlink strategy** - Waiting for links to magically appear (they won't)
9. **Chasing algorithm updates** - Focus on quality content, not gaming the system
10. **Buying links** - Google will eventually catch you and penalize hard
11. **Forgetting about E-E-A-T** - Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trust matter
12. **Not tracking metrics** - Can't improve what you don't measure

### Universal Pitfalls (Both)
1. **Impatience** - SEO takes 3-6 months minimum to show results
2. **Inconsistency** - Publishing sporadically won't build momentum
3. **Copying competitors** - Differentiate, don't replicate
4. **Ignoring user intent** - Write for what people actually want to know
5. **Over-complicating** - Start simple, iterate based on data

## 🎓 Key Principles to Remember

### LLM SEO Principles
1. **Clarity beats cleverness** - Write for robots first, humans second (in these specific files)
2. **Consistency is king** - Use the same phrases everywhere
3. **LLMs repeat, they don't rank** - You're programming what they say about you
4. **Markdown is magic** - LLMs love clean, structured text
5. **Test religiously** - Your assumptions about how LLMs work are probably wrong
6. **Be specific** - Vague descriptions = vague citations (or none at all)
7. **Think like a curator** - You're organizing information for AI consumption

### Traditional SEO Principles
1. **Content is still king** - Quality, helpful content wins long-term
2. **Technical foundation matters** - Fast, mobile-friendly, indexable sites rank
3. **User intent is everything** - Answer the question people are really asking
4. **E-E-A-T wins** - Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trust
5. **Backlinks = votes** - Quality links from relevant sites boost authority
6. **Patience pays** - SEO is a 6-12 month game, not a quick fix
7. **Consistency compounds** - Regular publishing builds momentum
8. **Data drives decisions** - Check Search Console, don't guess
9. **Mobile-first mandatory** - Optimize for mobile or die
10. **Be human** - Write for people, optimize for search engines second

### Universal Principles (Both)
1. **Your audience first** - Serve their needs, everything else follows
2. **Authenticity scales** - Trying to game systems eventually fails
3. **Compound effects** - Small consistent actions > big sporadic ones
4. **Differentiation matters** - Say something unique or say it uniquely
5. **Measure and iterate** - Test → Learn → Improve → Repeat
